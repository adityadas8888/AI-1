What is AI?
Systems that think rationally.

Goal of the course is to build a rational agent
Abstractly an agent is a function from percept histories to actions:
f:P*->A

PEAS Measures
To design a rational agent we need the following things

Performance measure
Environment
Actuator
Sensor
We are mostly gonna build goal based agents


Simple Reflex agents---- more or less if else , example  if room A is clean go to room B.

Reflex Agents with state---- has states example, if room X is clean fo to neighbour of room X
 
Goal based agents.
Utility based agents Most generic form of building rational agent. Most difficult to build.


Tree search algorithms. Optimize. Don't build a tree to search for something.
Implementation, nodes or states

Tree Search.

Branching Factor- Maximum number of possible ways. 
Max depth - How deep can the node go. Can be infinity if navigation or looping problem.

Uninformed Search Strategies.

BFS
Uniform Cost search
depth First search
Depth Limited search
Iterative deepening search


Properties of Breadth First search FIFO
Complete : Yes if b is finite
Time Complexity =  1+b+b2+b3+......... +b*b^d-1 === O(b^d+1)
Space complexity = cant really ditch memory, any node might lead to a solution
Optimality =  not very optimal, as we use the shallowest node. 


Properties of Uniform Cost search LIFO
its a generic version of the BFS
its implemented using a sorted list. expand least cost unexpanded node
fringe= queue ordered by path cost, lowest first
Equivalent to bfs if step costs all equal.
Complete : Yes if step cost >= small number
Time Complexity =  ###############
Space complexity = ###########
Optimality =  not very optimal, as we use the shallowest node.


Properties of Depth First search LIFO
deepest node search
fringe= queue ordered by path cost, lowest first
Equivalent to bfs if step costs all equal.
Complete : Yes if finite depth level
Time Complexity =  ###########
Space complexity = #############
Optimality =  NOT OPTIMAL, will find a solution, but not OPTIMAL
